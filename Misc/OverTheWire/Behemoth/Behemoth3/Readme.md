**Description:**  

This wargame deals with a lot of regular vulnerabilities found commonly 'out in the wild'. While the game makes no attempts at emulating a real environment it will teach you how to exploit several of the most common coding mistakes including buffer overflows, race conditions and privilege escalation.
