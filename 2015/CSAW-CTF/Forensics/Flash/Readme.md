We were able to grab an image of a harddrive. Find out what's on it.

##Write-up
Based on the information provided it appears that we will be dealing with an [image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_image) of a flash hard drive so I am expecting that I will be using forensic software to analyze the file.

As there are several ways to perform this CTF we included three different write ups.

![Flash Option 1](./Flash%20option%201.md)
This option provides a very high level approach using any commercial forensic software.

![Flash Option 2](./Flash%20option%202.md)
This option demonstrates how to use the Autopsy Forensic Browser with The Sleuth Kit running on the [SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit] (http://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/downloads).

![Flash Option 3](./Flash%20option%203.md)
This option demonstrates how to use The Sleuth Kit command 'srch_strings' running on the [SANS Investigative Forensic Toolkit] (http://digital-forensics.sans.org/community/downloads).
