We are left with an unkown numbers of steps, but at least we have somewhere to start.  Off to google.  Using both the his name and domain name for searches on linkedin we find the following.

Another quick google for USF's hacking club leads us to:

Trying the acronym leads us to step 2.

Here we are given a base64 encoded message.  Decoding gives us our next clue.

Back to google we go.  Using ```fuzyll``` and ```Super Smash Brothers``` we find a hit on ```smashboards.com```.

The profile name is ```fuzyll``` and with all of the postings regarding ```yoshi``` I believe we have our character.

This one took the longest by far.  A quick look back at his LinkedIn profile reveals that he has placed in the DEFCON finals for DEFCON 19, 20, 21, and 22.  I started my search on DEFCON 17 and 18 figuring he didn't make it to the finals on his first attempt.  A lot of searching led me here:

After many others tries, we finally hit ```enigma``` which in turn gives us:

This was another easy step.  We can use the developer tools to quickly run the javascript with the given string.

Doing so gives us the final path and in turn, the flag.
